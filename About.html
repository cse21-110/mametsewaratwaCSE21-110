                <h3>Company Overview</h3>
                <article>WARNER BROS. is a fully integrated entertainment company and a global leader in the creation, production, distribution, licensing and marketing of all forms of entertainment. A Warner Bros. Discovery company, the Studio is home to one of the most successful collections of brands in the world and stands at the forefront of every aspect of the entertainment industry, from feature film, television, digital and home entertainment production and worldwide distribution to DVD and Blu-ray, animation, comic books, videogames, and product and brand licensing. The company’s vast library, one of the most prestigious and valuable in the world, consists of more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprised of more than 150,000 individual episodes.
                    Warner Bros. began when the brothers Warner (Albert, Sam, Harry and Jack L.) incorporated their fledgling movie company on April 4, 1923. In 1927, the release of the world’s first “talkie,” (synchronized-sound feature film), “The Jazz Singer,” set a character and tone of creativity, courage, innovation and influence that would become synonymous with the name Warner Bros. And--as Al Jolson foretold in this milestone movie--“you ain’t heard nothin’ yet!”
                    Since those early days, Warner Bros. Studios has amassed an impressive legacy based on world-class quality entertainment and technological foresight and created a diversified entertainment company with an unparalleled depth and breadth. Its century of continued success has been built on a foundation of long-term creative relationships with many of the world’s leading talent, and an unwavering dedication to excellence.Founded: 1967
                    Building on more than 50 years of innovation and creativity, New Line Cinema continues its long and successful history of producing critically acclaimed hit films that resonate with both mainstream and niche audiences around the world.
                    New Line produced the Oscar winning “The Lord of the Rings” film trilogy, which generated a combined worldwide box office of almost $3 billion with an additional $3 billion in consumer products and home entertainment revenue. This was followed by a trilogy of films based on “The Hobbit,” which also generated nearly $3 billion in global receipts.
                    
                    A pioneer in the horror genre, New Line is widely known for the iconic “A Nightmare on Elm Street,” “Final Destination” and “Blade” franchises. In 2013, New Line released the global blockbuster “The Conjuring” which launched a horror universe that includes the hit films for “Annabelle” and “The Nun.” The seven films have earned more than $2 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing horror franchise of all time. In September 2017, New Line released “IT,” based on the classic Stephen King horror novel. “IT” was a global sensation and became the most successful horror film in history with more than $700 million at the worldwide box office. The 2019 sequel, “IT Chapter Two,” brought the franchise’s worldwide gross to more than $1 billion.
                    The Studio is credited with revitalizing the genre of the R-rated comedy with the success of “Wedding Crashers” in 2005, and has a history of producing crowd-pleasing comedies, including the “Friday,” “Austin Powers” and “Rush Hour” film franchises, as well as “Dumb and Dumber,” “The Wedding Singer,” “Elf,” “Horrible Bosses,” “We’re the Millers,” “Central Intelligence” and “Game Night.”
                    New Line’s long list of popular films also includes: “Mortal Kombat,” “Shazam!,” “Rampage,” “Me Before You,” “Creed” and “Creed II,” San Andreas,” “He’s Just Not That Into You,” “Journey to the Center of the Earth” and “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,” “Sex and the City” and “Sex and the City 2,” “Se7en,” “The Mask,” “The Notebook,” and “Hairspray.”
                    New Line’s current production model includes films produced for theatrical release as well as titles made specifically for the HBO Max streaming platform (both New Line and HBO Max are part of Warner Bros. Discovery). New Line’s 2022 release slate includes KIMI, Moonshot, House Party, Don’t Worry Darling and Black Adam.
